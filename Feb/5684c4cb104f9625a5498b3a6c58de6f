Agency Report A Filipina woman who recorded herself physically torturing her own daughter in order to take revenge on her ex-husband was arrested in Abu Dhabi yesterday, according to the UAE-based Gulf News. The woman, who has not been named, is reported to have recently divorced her Emirati husband. She then set about torturing her young daughter, recording the abuse and posted the ordeal on social media in order to tease and psychologically abuse the girl’s father. There were three video clips of the abuse which were released overall all with extremely disturbing content. In one clip, the mother drags her daughter across the floor by her legs while saying “You are an Arab, must use violence with you, go to the toilet.” In another clip, the young girl can be seen wearing only her underwear crying with bruises on her body, while still being brutally beaten by the mother as she screams in pain. When the footage was first released it was initially thought that the child was being abused at the hands of her nanny. However, after seeing the video himself, the father called Abu Dhabi Police, who have said that the mother has been arrested will face legal action.
