The attention of the Honourable Minister of Niger Delta Affairs,  Senator Godswill Akpabio has been drawn to a piece of fake news published by some rogue websites  led by Point Blank News that he has been denied entry visa into the United States of America.  We wish to alert the public that there is no iota of truth in the fabricated story. The truth is that on February 20, 2020, Senator Akpabio and the wife, Mrs Ekaette Unoma Godswill Akpabio appeared at the United States of America Embassy in Abuja to renew their visas. Being regular visitors to the United States of America both of them were granted the visas. It smacks of junk  journalism for anybody to fabricate the story that Senator Akpabio was denied entry visa to US for whatever reason. The general public should discountenance this piece of fake news as concoction from mischief makers. Anietie Ekong
