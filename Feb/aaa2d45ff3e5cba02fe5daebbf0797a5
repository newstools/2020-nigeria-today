Emmanuel, who was accompanied by his wife, Martha, and the state deputy governor, Mr Moses Ekpo, said that the funeral service of his late father came to serve as a bridge building ceremony, remarking that the gathering cut across all segments of individuals on the surface of the earth. The governor said that his late father was a true example of a biological father with impeccable character rather than the simple possession of charisma, explaining that his late biological father stood by him, his brothers and sisters beyond the clout given by his economic, spiritual and political fathers at moments of dire needs. He stressed that the character of the deceased has come to bear fruits of inspirations and hope of substance to all individuals in the immediate community and in the Christendom, maintaining that the honour given to them at the response of sympathizers would continue to remain evergreen in the memory of the family members. The chairman of conference, QIC, Reverend Ekpedeme Efanga, who read from Luke 15:9-12 and 1 Corinthians 4:2, said that all persons came to be born with assignments on earth to serve as stewards and accountable to God, adding that accountability to God requires the keeping to instructions and commandments at all moments. Efanga, who preached on the theme, The Faithfulness of Stewards, remarked that the hope of being a faithful steward calls for unbroken relationship with God in exhibiting leadership qualities and meeting followership expectations, adding that Christians in leadership positions have to ensure the payment of dues to their stewards in demonstration of excellent examples. A biography of the deceased indicated that the late Nkanang lived for 90 years serving as a missionary and teacher at various locations in the state and the country. Prior to the funeral service, the deceased family had hosted a sea head of persons during a singsong and friendsâ€™ night and a subsequent thanksgiving service all at Awa Iman in Onna Local Government Area.
