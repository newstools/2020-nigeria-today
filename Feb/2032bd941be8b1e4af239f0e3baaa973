By Itohowo Robinson The Vice-chairman House of Representatives committee on communication, Hon. Unyime Idem has urged the Federal Government to reconstitute the Federal Character Commission following the expiration of the tenure of the previous Commissioners and the Chairman of the Commission. Hon. Idem in the motion on the floor of the house noted that although the main purpose of setting up the Federal Character Commission was to maintain the Federal Character Policy across the Country, the Commission has failed to maintain its internal appointment according to the Federal Character Procedure. The Lawmaker regretted that the Commission was parading only one Commissioner instead of thirty-seven and the only existing Commissioner was also the acting Chairman of the Commission. He said it was worrisome that the Acting Chairman would be bowing out of office in April 2020 having completed his tenure in office as allowed by the law. The Lawmaker who represents Ukanafun/Oruk Anam Federal Constituency noted that the Commission with such a shortage of hands cannot make decisions that was favorable to all States of the Federation and the FCT as required by law. “There is a huge responsibility of handling a high volume of representation that one individual cannot make the decision favorable to all States of the Federation as required. Having no representation would make the equitable inefficient, thereby having a ripple effect on the development system of the Country” he noted “The reduction in the number of Commissioners will certainly slow down the equitable dispensation of development across boards”. The motion received massive support from other Lawmakers and the House resolved to: 1. Urge the Federal Government to appoint thirty-seven Commissioners into the Federal Character Commission. 2. Mandate the House Committee on Federal Character to ensure compliance. The motion was voted on and passed Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook
