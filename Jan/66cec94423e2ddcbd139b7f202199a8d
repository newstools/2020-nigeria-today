…calls for more participation and partnership By Emma Akpabio, Uyo As part of their corporate social responsibilities, more than 10 organizations in Akwa Ibom State on Saturday, voluntarily joined the January edition of the statewide monthly environmental sanitation exercise through the clean-up campaign organized by Passion 94.5FM radio, in partnership with the Akwa Ibom State Environmental Protection and waste management Agency (AKPSEPWMA). As earlier announced, the exercise took place simultaneously across 30 local government areas of the State except for Essien Udim, where a court-ordered rerun election held.  Fielding questions from journalists, the Board Chairman of AKSEPWMA, Obong Prince Ikim who was on the streets of Uyo to monitor public compliance, expressed satisfaction with the massive turn out of citizenry, despite the notice of “no restriction of movement between 7 am and 10 am”. Ikim who also applauded the attitude of some residents of the State capital towards desilting the gutters in front of their homes ordered that abatement notices be immediately served to those shop owners who have not ‘desilted’ the gutters in front of their shops, despite a repeated directive by the State Government. On the participation of some corporate organizations in the exercise, the youngest Board Chairman in Akwa Ibom State who reiterated that keeping the environment clean is not the responsibility of the government alone thanked the different organizations and Uyo local government council Boss and his entourage for deciding to join the sanitation exercise. He particularly extolled the management of Passion 94.5FM Uyo, for successfully organizing her maiden edition of Clean- up campaign, while calling on other corporate organizations to emulate the action of the leading radio Station. The former Council Head of Oruk Anam local government Area while also noting that many streets have been littered with the silts removed from gutters during the sanitation exercise, called on the citizens of the State to remain calm, adding that his Agency will ensure prompt evacuation of all accumulated waste during the post sanitation exercise which according to him, continues tomorrow and ends on Wednesday, January 29, 2020 with a mob exercise. Some of the corporate organizations that partnered with passion FM radio for the exercise were; Ibom hotel and golf resort, Nigeria Police Force, Nigeria Medical Association, Crunches fast food, tantalizer, Honeywell flour meal, Gifto, Promo Master, hypo toilet cleaner amongst others.
