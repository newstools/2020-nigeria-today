Press Release Protest against Imo Robbery to hold on Sunday 19th January In line with the resolution reached at the last National Executive Committee meeting of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party, there will be a peaceful protest march on Sunday, January 19,2020 by 2pm. The take off point will be the state party secretariat,113 Edet Akpan Avenue, uyo. The March is to register our displeasure over the  recent political robbery in Imo state, where the apex court strangely computed and announced results which are contradictory with the existing reality, in the Governorship elections which held in March 2019. Silence in the face of tyrannical occurrences may be interpreted as acquiescence, therefore we must all turn up to register our displeasure over this senseless and most vexatious development.
