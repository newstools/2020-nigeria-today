By Richard Peters The conception of Ibom Air and its timely execution is a great plus to Akwa Ibom State. Not only has the Airline projected Akwa Ibom to the world, its services have been adjudged as one of the best in the country. Their schedules are respected, as their take- off schedules are not compromised for any reason,and treatment of passengers on board the plane are of international standard. Such services which are the much-talked about by users of airlines are quite commendable. Kudos to Gov. Emmanuel who initiated the project, and strictly ensured that their services are of international standard. Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook
