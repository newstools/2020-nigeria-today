The attention of Akwa Ibom State Government has been drawn to the fake news making rounds on social media about a purported dissolution of the State Executive Council by His Excellency, the Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel. This fake news is a figment of imagination of some mischief makers. It is a meek and condemnable attempt to cause distraction. The State Government remains undaunted in the pursuit of its sustainable and people oriented development agenda. Signed:
